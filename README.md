## Data and Visualizations of interest

**Find a journal or newspaper article that relates data science to a humanities topic that you are interested in.**

        I am interested and passionate about affordable housing because I come from a low-income background and I've struggled with finding housing that we can afford. This article goes into detail about how data science and specifically how GIS can improve and streamline housing development. 

A research project that matches my research interests is called "Combatting Homelessness in Los Angeles County" by ARCGIS. Here is the 
link to the project.

## Relations to My Project
This research project uses datasets released by the Los Angeles Housing Authrority to not only map the homeless population, but also to ***predict*** where homelessness will arise and which areas are more likeley to foster homelessness. They do this by analyzing other key factors such as: poverty, addiction, lack of affordable housing, unemployment, mental illness, domestic violence, and high health care costs (ESRI 2021).

I want my final project top be about the housing crisis in Los Angeles. Examining this research project by ARCGIS is a good starting point because they list the datasets they use. This is a good foundation to my project since I will be using the same datasets as well.

A data visualiztion they created that inbterests me for my own project is the ones where they predict homelessness. Ther data viz is a map of Los Angeles, color coded in pink. The darker the area is, the more at-risk it is for it's residents to become homeless.

I will be creating mapping visualztions for my project. 


**Find a data visualization that you would love to know how to make with Python. Include the image in the next cell too and comment on why you like it.**

        I like this data visualization because of the color coding and the simplicity of it by using mapping. 
        
        
 Datasets useful for my project are the general homeless count in Los Angeles, the low-ioncome housing availaiobity of Los Angelkes, and the amount of tents and campers in Los Angeles. I alreeady found these datasets in the Los Angeles Homeless Authorioty website.

## Ideas for Data to Investigate


**Write a bulleted list of 2 or 3 humanities topics of interest to you.**

Three humanities topics that interest me: housing, educational attainment for POC, and conversational analysis for solving and identifying humanistic issues.
